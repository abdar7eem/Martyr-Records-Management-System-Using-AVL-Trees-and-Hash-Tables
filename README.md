# Martyr-Records-Management-System-Using-AVL-Trees-and-Hash-Tables
The purpose of this Java project is to manage a dataset of martyr records using a combination of advanced data structures, including an AVL tree, hash table, queues/stacks, and heaps. The main component of the system is a hash table that organizes martyr records based on the date of death. The hash table uses both separate chaining and quadratic probing techniques to handle collisions, ensuring that records with the same date are stored efficiently within an AVL tree. The AVL tree is further used to store and sort martyr records by district and full name.

The project also incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) built using JavaFX, allowing users to load martyr records from a CSV file, interact with the data, and perform various operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting records. Users can navigate through the hash table, display summaries, and view records in a sorted manner using AVL trees and heap sorting.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are integral to the project. Encapsulation is used to bundle the martyr records and their associated data into distinct classes. Inheritance and polymorphism allow the project to extend functionality and handle various operations like data insertion and deletion efficiently. The use of the AVL tree and hash table showcases how data structures can be abstracted into objects and interact seamlessly within a Java application
